# Solar-Powered-LIPO-Battery-Charger
Circuit design and construction of Lithium Polymer Battery Charger based on the LM317 adjustable voltage regulator. This was completed as the final design project of the course 3312ENG. The circuit is aimed to charge a 2S Lithium Polymer battery safely from a 12V solar panel, the below outlines the design steps and construction of the circuit. 

## Background
Lithium Polymer

## Design Steps
The overall design process is broken down into three categories
    - __Circuit Design__ - Designing the charging circuitry
    - __Solar Panel Regulator__ - Regulating the output of the solar panel
    - __Modelling and Construction__ - Creating a base for the solar panel and housing for the circuitry.

## Circuit Design
Many designs are possibly
